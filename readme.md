# OpenKlave

## Introduction

OpenKlave is an open source operating system for the Akai MPK2 keyboard series, including the MPK 225, MPK249, and the MPK261.

The launch goal of the project is to permit keyboard users to load and execute arbitrary code onto the keyboard using only a usb cable to the keyboard and stock software.
It is intended to work around and augment the stock bootloader and operating system, instead of replacing them.

If the launch goal is reached and there's community interest, we will work towards a from-scratch rewrite of both the bootloader and operating system.

## Project purpose and copyright note

This project was started because the MPK249 is a beautiful device, full of promise, with terrible software. It has fun light pads and nice-feeling keys.
But the MPK249 barely interacts with Ableton. One can fix many issues using sysex commands run from a laptop, but certain issues require modifying the system software.
For example, one cannot currently write arbitrary messages to the LCD screen without completely freezing the system.

This project does not copy or redistribute any copyright-protectible software from Akai or any other source. The MPK2 series has no encryption mechanism
which prevents modificaiton. As device owners, it is our legal right to arbitrarily modify our devices without restriction, and to write and share original software
to advance this purpose.

If you receive any notifications from any party to the contrary, let us know in the Github Issues. 

## Diving in

A whole lot of modification can be achieved just by sending sysex commands to the MPK2 device, for example by using rtmidi to send midi messages from your laptop to the device.
Doing this, you can change the colors on the keypads, and even intercept and modify midi messages between the device and your software.
